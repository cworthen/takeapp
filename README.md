## takeapp

Completed: January 2017

### Summary:
For this project, I converted the "Take" psd template into a responsive landing page. I used Bootstrap 4, HTML5 and CSS3 along with Javascript to make the page more interactive. "Take" is a fictional mobile app designed for taking photos and photo effects. You can see the original psd here, created by Blazrobar.

### Challenges:

Converting the psd to a landing page stretched my ability to pay close attention to detail and also make sure the page is fully responsive or mobile friendly.

### What I learned:

I learned how to take a design and code it into reality. This project also strengthened my understanding of Bootstrap.

Technology used:
HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 4, Media Queries, Javascript
